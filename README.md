# Chess
This is a C++ console-based Chess game, implemented with a simple graphics library. It provides three distinct game modes and robust save/load capabilities.

**Features:**
* **Classic, Rapid, and Blitz Modes:** Choose from three distinct game modes to cater to different playing styles and time constraints.
* **Game Save/Load:** Implement the functionality to save a game's current state and load it later, allowing players to continue where they left off.
* **New Game Initialization:** Start a new Chess game programmatically, providing flexibility in game setup.
